This is a personal project exploring and mapping the relative income of residents along each MTA subway line. New Yorkers often identify with the subway line(s) they ride the most. I was interested in seeing how income correlated with each line, and how demographic trends across the city can be reflected in the community that relies on each line.

I used MTA Open Data and US Census ACS estimates for this analysis. To map it, I used Mapbox GL JS and pulled some code from Chris Whong's subway template (ADD LINK) to speed along the process.
